# About
I am a British Academy Postdoctoral Fellow [@rhulecon](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/economics/).

I try to understand marital sorting patterns - primarily across ethnic boundaries - and implications for social integration. I also study how people from diverse backgrounds - including socio-economic status, ethnicity, sexual orientation - make education choices.
